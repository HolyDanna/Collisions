To use the program with the simulation, just run the main.py using python3.
You need pygame in order to run this project (downloadable at http://pygame.org/download.shtml ).
To use the test, open python, and use 'from test import *' to launch the test. 
Setting the variable i prior to loading the test will show each and every collision test result. The result is true when a collision happens.
You can see the figures used for the tests in the report.
As points are the same as circle, collision-wise, and polygons are the same as OBB, we didn't add test specifically for those.

This program was written by Simon BASILIEN and Florian FICHANT using the pygame documentation
